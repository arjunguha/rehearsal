# == Definition: apache::confd::file_exists
#
# Defines a file if, and only if, the file is not defined
# anywhere else.
#
# Uses the +path+  as name for the file resource. Also defaults the
# owner and group to what is defined in apache::params (daemon_user/group)
#
# For these kind of files, we do not notify the service my default since
# the resource that called this will probably do so on itself.
#
# If the file is a directory, and purge is not true, it will not replace symlinks.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# === Todo:
#
# * TODO: Update documentation.
