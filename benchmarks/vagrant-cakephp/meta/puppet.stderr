[1;31mError: Could not request certificate: The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent's private key.
Certificate fingerprint: 36:A9:05:FF:F4:C4:C5:BF:AB:0D:0A:6A:48:B2:B9:3D:4C:B0:72:BC:A5:DC:7E:C5:C5:EA:28:85:BA:69:22:91
To fix this, remove the certificate from both the master and the agent and then start a puppet run, which will automatically regenerate a certficate.
On the master:
  puppet cert clean agent
On the agent:
  rm -f /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/agent.pem
  puppet agent -t
